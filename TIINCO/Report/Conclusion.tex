\chapter{Conclusion}
In this project, the goal of implementing a working Meggitt decoder in MATLAB with a instructional GUI, has succeeded.
It fulfils all the requirements stated in the assignment, and succeeds in providing an even more general solution than required.

This it satisfying, in the sense that, this project may be used to better instruct other students of Meggitt decoding, in the inner workings of the Meggitt decoder. 

Other than succeeding in implementing a Meggitt decoder, the project also succeeded in giving the participants a much greater insight into the power and efficiency of cyclic codes, when implemented.
