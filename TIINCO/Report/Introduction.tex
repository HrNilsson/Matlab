\chapter{Introduction}
The object of this project is to learn about cyclic codes and try to implement a so-called Meggitt decoder.
The Meggitt decoder will be implemented in a stepwise manner and all intermediate steps have been visualised using a Matlab GUI. 

This paper will give a short theory of the Meggitt decoder, describe the requirements for the project, and explain the actual implementation in Matlab.
Finally a conclusion on the implementation will be given.
